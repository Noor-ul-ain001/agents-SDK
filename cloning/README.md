ðŸ§© What is clone()?

The clone() method creates a duplicate agent from an existing one.

It preserves the instructions and model.

It allows you to create a new agent instance without rewriting all configuration details.

It is helpful in workflows where you may want multiple agents with the same behavior but different contexts.

ðŸŽ¯ Why Use clone()?

Reusability â†’ Quickly create new agents with the same base configuration.

Isolation â†’ Keep the original agent unchanged while experimenting with the clone.

Flexibility â†’ You can later modify the cloned agent (e.g., change its instructions) without affecting the original one.
